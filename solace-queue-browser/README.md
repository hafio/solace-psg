# Solace Queue Browser

## Overview

This is a open-source non-production tool that is not officially supported under Solace Customer Support policy.

This is meant to provide Solace Queue Browsing capabilities easily:
- List messages in queue
- Browse (Peek) message payload content without consuming message from the queue
- Remove message from the queue

The application is intended to be able to run without a web server (with constraints) - refer to section below for explanation.
